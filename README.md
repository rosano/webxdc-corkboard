# Corkboard

Sample app demonstrating CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Each participant can modify items in their own 'board' or list; this is a simple hack to avoid overwriting conflicts when used in groups. Each update brings the respective board to the top so that other participants know what changed.

For CRUD operations with Automerge, see [Checklist](https://github.com/webxdc/webxdc-checklist).
